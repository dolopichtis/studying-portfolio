# Abstract

This is the realization of the second practical assignment of the front-end course of [SH++ school](https://programming.org.ua)
The basic idea is to learn basic JS commands. 

One can watch the page here: <https://dolopichtis.github.io/studying-portfolio/js/pureJS/>

# Tools and methodology

- I used different methods to acheive the result. Widely, I used Self Invoking Function to add event listeners to DOM elements.
- The code was written with the VIM code editor and some additional tools, and plugins.
- GIT

# Main work

I learned to use the basic JS commands to manipulate with the DOM. I learned to work with Session and Local Storages, and Cookies as a user's data storage.

# Conclusions

I found many interesting ways to manipulate elements of the DOM of a web page and dynamically change the styles of those elements.
