# Abstract

This is my realization of the first practical assignment of the front-end course of [SH++ school](https://programming.org.ua)
The basic idea is to learn to turn a Figma design into not so complex web page by using HTML and CSS

# Tools and methodology

- I choose to use Semantic CSS practice to achieve the goal - complete webpage styling.
- To wright the code I learned to use the VIM code editor with some additional tools and plugins.
- I use the flex-column property with nth-child selector to change the order for organizing "cards" to the Masonry view (<https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/masonry-with-css/>).
- GIT
- All CSS properties are divided to files in folders:
	- The "box" subfolder contains .css files of each page section. Each file is used to define "box" size and positions; Also it contains color.css wich defines to colors of elements. general.css - is used to define general styles;
	- owl-carousel - is for the library code.
	- text - is a folder with css files that define text styles.
	- style.css - is for adding fonts (also it can be used for @import all of needed .css)

# Main work

I learned to use the Semantic CSS to style HTML, it is cool :D and efficient way to do the work.
It was an interesting challenge to realize the Masonry layout for the "services" section.
I spent 40 hours (without the theory part) finishing the code.

# Conclusions

I found many interesting ways to make a web page and style it. And many different naming conventions in CSS practice.
The best way (in my opinion) is the Semantic CSS.
